gcfetch
=======

An old Perl script that I wrote years ago to download geocache descriptions from the website. I haven't used it lately, and honestly don't know if it still works or not. I suspect not.

Why even put it up on GitHub then?
----------------------------------

I have two reasons for even putting this out there:

1. Occasionally someone asks me about this after reading the (also old) geocaching page on my website.
2. As an (early) example of my code.
